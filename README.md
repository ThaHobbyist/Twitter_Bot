# Twitter_Bot

These are a few bots I scripted for the glug auditions.
All the bots are scripted in tweepy and python unless mentioned.

**1. glug_twitter_bot.py**
This bot checks the replies to all the tweets in which it is mentioned for a specific text, in this case, 'bot' and replies to that reply.

**2. search_for_#hobbist.py**
This is a multithreaded bot(only 2 threads for now) which searches for a tweet for a particular text or hashtag, #hobbist in this case, and replies to the tweet, 'I too support #hobbist' in this case.

**3. selenium_bot.py**
this a bot made with python and selenium which checks if the #2 bot is working.
